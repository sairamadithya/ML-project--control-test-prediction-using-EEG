# ML-project--control-test-prediction-using-EEG
This project involves the development of ML models for several EEG datasets. These datasets are about the EEG signal raw data for control and test conditions of patients.
The EEG raw data is acquired through 2 ways, namely PAC and PLV.
The signals are taken in three different conditions, namely awake, eyes open and eyes closed.
The work is to build ML models to classify the given patient as one amongst four classes (control, test-1, test-2, test-3).
